## Overview

This repository houses a modern, optimized engineering portfolio designed for speed, scalability, and visual excellence. Built with a focus on type safety and performance, it serves as a technical demonstration of modern frontend architecture, leveraging a component-based design system and hardware-accelerated animations.

## Key Features

- **Type-Safe Data Orchestration:** Utilizes a centralized TypeScript configuration for all project and skill data, ensuring structural integrity and eliminating runtime errors across the UI.
- **Observer-Driven Interactivity:** Employs the Intersection Observer API for performance-aware animations, triggering visual transitions only when elements enter the viewport to minimize CPU overhead.
- **Fluid Responsive Architecture:** Implements a mobile-first, utility-driven layout system using Tailwind CSS, featuring complex glassmorphism effects and dynamic gradient overlays without sacrificial performance.
- **Optimized Asset Pipeline:** Powered by Vite for sub-second hot module replacement and efficient bundling, resulting in a lean, high-performance production build.
